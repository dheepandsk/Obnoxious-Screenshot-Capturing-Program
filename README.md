Don't miss a moment with the Obnoxious Screenshot Capturing Program(OSCP)! This tool goes beyond just simple screenshots, it allows you to set the frequency and gives you the control over what you store on your system.

The program is written in C# and the GUI was created using Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF). The program is designed to be sleek and efficient allowing the user to set the pace at which the screenshots are taken, the naming convention of the images, and where they're stored on disk. The program uses state of the art technology that captures what's on screen and converts it to a bitmap so it can be transferred to primary storage.

The logo was created by skewing a royalty free SVG image I took from IconFinder. Shoutout to the original creator.

This project was inspired by Bmjslider who originally posted the concept on reddit.
